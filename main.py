Creating a comprehensive auto-expense tracker that utilizes OCR and machine learning to track, categorize, and visualize expenses involves several steps. Below is a simplified version of such a project. This basic implementation will use Python's popular libraries like OpenCV and Tesseract for OCR, scikit-learn for machine learning, and matplotlib for visualization. This code assumes that expenses are extracted from receipts or invoices. Here is a complete Python program with comments and error handling:

```python
import cv2
import pytesseract
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer
from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
from typing import List, Tuple

# Set path to Tesseract executable
pytesseract.pytesseract.tesseract_cmd = r'C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR\tesseract.exe'  # Update this path as needed

class ExpenseTracker:
    def __init__(self):
        # Predefined categories (more can be added)
        self.categories = ['food', 'transport', 'utilities', 'entertainment', 'others']
        self.vectorizer = CountVectorizer()
        self.classifier = MultinomialNB()

    def extract_text_from_image(self, image_path: str) -> str:
        """Extract text from an image using OCR."""
        try:
            image = cv2.imread(image_path)  # Read the image
            if image is None:
                raise ValueError("Failed to load image. Check the path or file format.")
            gray_img = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)  # Convert to grayscale
            text = pytesseract.image_to_string(gray_img)  # Perform OCR
            return text
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error in extracting text: {e}")
            return ""

    def categorize_expense(self, description: str) -> str:
        """Categorize the expense based on the description."""
        try:
            X = self.vectorizer.transform([description])
            predicted_category_index = self.classifier.predict(X)[0]
            return self.categories[predicted_category_index]
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error in categorizing expense: {e}")
            return "unknown"

    def train_classifier(self, data: List[Tuple[str, str]]):
        """Train the ML model with labeled data."""
        try:
            descriptions, labels = zip(*data)
            X_train = self.vectorizer.fit_transform(descriptions)
            y_train = np.array([self.categories.index(label) for label in labels])
            self.classifier.fit(X_train, y_train)
            print("Training complete.")
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error in training classifier: {e}")

    def visualize_expenses(self, expenses: List[Tuple[str, float]]):
        """Visualize expenses as a pie chart."""
        try:
            amounts = [expense[1] for expense in expenses]
            labels = [expense[0] for expense in expenses]
            plt.figure(figsize=(8, 8))
            plt.pie(amounts, labels=labels, autopct='%1.1f%%')
            plt.title("Expenses Distribution")
            plt.show()
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error in visualizing expenses: {e}")

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    tracker = ExpenseTracker()

    # Fake training data: (description, category)
    training_data = [
        ("Lunch at restaurant", "food"),
        ("Bus ticket", "transport"),
        ("Electricity bill payment", "utilities"),
        ("Movie ticket", "entertainment")
    ]

    # Train the classifier
    tracker.train_classifier(training_data)

    # Assume image_path is a path to a receipt image
    image_path = "receipt.jpg"  # Update with actual image file path
    text = tracker.extract_text_from_image(image_path)
    print(f"Extracted Text: {text}")

    # Categorize a sample expense
    category = tracker.categorize_expense("Lunch at local diner")
    print(f"Categorized as: {category}")

    # Visualize a sample expense list
    sample_expenses = [
        ("food", 50),
        ("transport", 20),
        ("utilities", 100),
        ("entertainment", 40)
    ]
    tracker.visualize_expenses(sample_expenses)
```

### Important Considerations:
1. **Tesseract OCR Path**: You need to install the Tesseract OCR engine and update the `pytesseract.pytesseract.tesseract_cmd` with the correct path to the `tesseract` executable.

2. **Training Data**: The classifier is trained with sample labeled data. You should update this with your own labeled expense data for accurate predictions.

3. **Error Handling**: Basic error handling is provided. You may need to enhance this depending on your specific use case.

4. **Dependencies**: Make sure to install required libraries using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python pytesseract scikit-learn matplotlib
   ```

5. **Receipt Image**: You need actual receipt images to test the OCR functionality. Image paths need to be updated accordingly.

This basic template can be expanded to include features like database integration, more complex machine learning models, or a GUI for better usability.
